# PhD_AI
Can generate concepts and fields in research papers, taking input of a researcher's name. Will eventually link to CV, so it will help identify common fields of interest between you and researchers and produce a cover letter/email to them, to help you get started with PhD applications. 

Run 'main.py' after inputting the name of a researcher of your choosing
You may need to change the engineered prompt to specify your area of interest (it is currently 'physics' and 'mathematics' based), and add some examples. 
To add such examples, simply find the abstract of a research paper, paste it, and note the key concepts and fields within it. 

Note: you will need to obtain your own OpenAI API key. This is easy and there are plenty of tutorials on youtube. 
You then need to set up a .env file in your Project folder, and put the key in there.
Run source .env (or similar) in terminal for your Project to link your .env as the source for keys. 
The conda environment for the project is here in the repo, you will also need to configure that.
